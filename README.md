## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Part 1: Gaussian kernel with SVMs

Working with 2D dataset which can be separated by linear boundary by using SVM.
Using Gaussian kernel to find non-linear boundary.

### Part 2: Spam Classification

Building a spam classifier using SVM only by using the body of email.
After training you can try out your own email body by replacing the text in spamSamples and emailSamples.
